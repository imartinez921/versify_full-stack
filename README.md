## [Versify](https://versify-idm-402fcc1678c6.herokuapp.com/) is a clone of the Spotify web client but with a darker and starry undertone.
### Versify provides a very similar user experience to Spotify online, with a focus on Afropop and R&B genres. 
(Note: All music is for non-commercial use as this is a private project.)
